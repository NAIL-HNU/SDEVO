## Deep Visual Odometry for Stereo Event Cameras
### Coming Soon

This repository contains the code implementation for our paper titled "Deep Visual Odometry for Stereo Event Cameras", soon to be released.

### Abstract

We present a deep learning-based method for visual odometry using stereo event cameras. Our approach significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of motion estimation in high-speed and low-light environments by leveraging the asynchronous nature of event data.

### Comparing with us

We encourage comparative evaluations before the release of the full project. If you require the original trajectory data for comparison, feel free to contact us.
