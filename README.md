## Deep Visual Odometry for Stereo Event Cameras
### Coming Soon

This repository contains the code implementation for our paper titled "Deep Visual Odometry for Stereo Event Cameras", soon to be released.

### Abstract

We present a deep learning-based method for visual odometry using stereo event cameras. The proposed system is built on top of DEVO, a monocular event-only VO system that leverages a learned patch selector and a pooled multinomial sampling for tracking sparse event patches.

### Comparing with us

We encourage comparative evaluations before the release of the full project. If you require the original trajectory data for comparison, feel free to contact us.
